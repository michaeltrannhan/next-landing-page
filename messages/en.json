    "desc": "Using an ordinary software development outsourcing can be very expensive, the cost can reach a few million JPY very easily. This high cost often acts as a bareer to make ideas come to life for many startups and new business development functions. Canaan Advisors will break that bareer and enable you to build a software development team for the lowest price in the industry.",
    "desc1": "We achieve the starting price of 280,000 JPY by teaming up our bilingual CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and PM (Project Manager) with our off-shore SE (Software Engineers). This will also enable smooth communication within the team, keeping high efficiency of the team-work."
